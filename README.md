# D&D AI Assistant
WORK IN PROGRESS

An AI assistant integrated with Obsidian, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Langchain. Designed to help with generating new content, planning sessions, and querying existing notes within the context of a Dungeons & Dragons (homebrew) database. Current implementation will use a local vector database (Chroma) and local LLMs (Ollama) to maintain full vault context and privacy.
