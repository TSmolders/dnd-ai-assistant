# D&D AI Assistant
WORK IN PROGRESS

An AI assistant integrated with Obsidian, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Designed to help with generating new content, planning sessions, and querying existing notes within the context of a Dungeons & Dragons (homebrew) database. Current implementation will use a local vector database and local LLMs (via Ollama) to maintain full vault context and privacy.
